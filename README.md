# data-scraping-2021
A repository containing the projects for my data scraping class, summer term 2021 at the University of Bamberg.

## Content of course and this repo

The attended course focuses on *obtaining* raw data rather than conducting some fancy analyses with it. This is also the case for the Jupyter Notebooks in this repo.

As far as real **topics** are concerned, there is a wide variety:

***A first project included:***

+ Scraping Tweets off of Twitter by using its API (included a small analysis of Tweets, we scraped the timelines of politicians Christian Lindner and Annalena Baerbock)
+ The inevitable *Covid19-Scraping-Project*, where I was able to scrape data provided by the M-Media-Group Coronavirus-API (included active cases, death tolls etc. for a lot of countries, not only in Europe). Analysis itself then focused on Italy and Germany.

***My second project which is also the second part of the term paper revolves around newspapers/media outlets in the US and their way of reporting on different topics and is more of an explorative analysis.*** More about this may follow in the README.
